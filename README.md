1. Run this code during your stream session and create a new html source directing to the local host server.
   
2. Make sure you replace the token="YOUR TOKEN HERE" with your actual outbrk game token found here: https://api.outbrkgame.com/ (Make sure your profile is public!)

3. To reset your stats for the next streaming session to 0, go to "http://127.0.0.1:5000/reset" or whatever your host URL is. I tried to set up a reset button on the html page but it kept showing up on the overlay. I didn't want to mess with it so I removed it.

Enjoy!
